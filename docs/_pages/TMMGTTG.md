# Welcome to the Mount Maker's Guide to the Galaxy!

This is a guide to make eye tracking mounts for EyeTrackVR!

*p.s: this guide is going to refer to EyeTrackVR as ETVR*

***Without further ado, lets get into it!***

## Considerations, and Concerns

Eye tracking is a tricky, finicky thing. Normally, when companies intergrate eye tracking into their headsets, tolerances and conditions are much tighter, however due to the nature of this project, we must be able to accomadate tons of diffrent configurations! There are considerations and concerns model makers are going to have to take to heart! But Dont Panic! This guide will help you get through it!

1) Lighthing: For ETVR lighting is one of the most critcal and essental things to get right! Without proper ligthing, ETVR would be unable to find the pupil accurately and may think other parts of the eye are the pupil.

2) Camera Postioning: When an ETVR tracks a pupil, the pupil must be in line of sight of the camera at all time, in all rotations. We tend to see the most issues when a user looks at their nose.
